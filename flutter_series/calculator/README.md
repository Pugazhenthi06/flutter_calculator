# 🧮 Flutter Calculator App

A simple, responsive calculator built using **Flutter** and **Dart**, with support for basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

> Developed as part of my Flutter learning journey by following the [Error Makes Clever](https://www.youtube.com/@ErrorMakesClever) YouTube channel, with personal improvements and code modifications.
